## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

### OCI Registry

OCI registries are preferred in Helm as they implement unified storage,
distribution, and improved security.

All Grafana Community Helm charts are available as [OCI artifacts on ghcr.io](https://github.com/orgs/grafana-community/packages?repo_name=helm-charts).

```console
helm install RELEASE-NAME oci://ghcr.io/grafana-community/helm-charts/<chart-name>
```

### HTTP Registry

Alternatively we also support legacy HTTP Registry format.

```console
helm repo add grafana-community https://grafana-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install RELEASE-NAME grafana-community/<chart-name>
```

## Helm Provenance and Integrity

All charts in this repository are signed. More information about how to verify charts can be found in the official [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/provenance/).

A local running gpg agent is mandatory.

To import the signing key for this repository, please run the following command:

```console
curl https://grafana-community.github.io/helm-charts/pubkey.gpg | gpg --import
```

After importing the key, you can use the `--verify` flag during `helm install` to enable chart signature validation.
